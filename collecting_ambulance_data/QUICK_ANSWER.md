# Quick Answer: Do You Need to Change Data Collection Code?

## YES! ✅ Already Fixed

### What Was Wrong
- Data collection was using `highway-v0` for ALL 30 scenarios
- Roundabouts, intersections, corners, and merges would have been collected as straight highways
- Your dataset would have lacked geometric diversity

### What We Fixed
**File**: `highway_datacollection/environments/factory.py`

Added automatic environment selection:
- `roundabout_*` scenarios → use `roundabout-v0` (circular roads)
- `intersection_*` and `corner_*` scenarios → use `intersection-v0` (crossing roads)
- `merge_*` scenarios → use `merge-v0` (merging lanes)
- `highway_*` scenarios → use `highway-v0` (straight roads)

### Verify the Fix Works
```bash
cd /home/chettra/ITC/Research/AVs
source avs_venv/bin/activate
python3 collecting_ambulance_data/scenarios/test_env_selection.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED! 10/10
✅ Data collection will use:
   - highway-v0 for highway scenarios (straight roads)
   - roundabout-v0 for roundabout scenarios (circular roads)  
   - intersection-v0 for corner/intersection scenarios (crossing roads)
   - merge-v0 for merge scenarios (merging lanes)
```

### Your Data Collection Command is NOW CORRECT! 🎉

```bash
python collecting_ambulance_data/examples/parallel_ambulance_collection.py \
    --episodes 1000 \
    --max-steps 100 \
    --output-dir data/ambulance_dataset_30k_cpu \
    --max-workers 20 \
    --batch-optimize \
    --seed 42
```

This will collect:
- ✅ 15 highway scenarios with straight roads
- ✅ 3 roundabout scenarios with circular roads ⭕
- ✅ 7 intersection/corner scenarios with crossing roads 🌐
- ✅ 5 merge scenarios with merging lanes 🛣️

**Total: 30,000 episodes with genuine road diversity!** 🚀

---

## TL;DR
✅ **Fixed**: Code automatically selects correct environments  
✅ **No Manual Changes Needed**: Works with existing parallel collection script  
✅ **Ready to Collect**: Your command will now capture diverse road geometries
