# Ambulance Multi-Modal Data Collection Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The ambulance data collection system was only collecting **1 type of data** (Kinematics) instead of the required **3 types of data** as specified in the requirements.

## Root Cause
The ambulance scenarios in `collecting_ambulance_data/scenarios/ambulance_scenarios.py` had hardcoded observation configurations that only supported Kinematics observations:

```python
# BEFORE (hardcoded - only Kinematics)
"observation": {
    "type": "MultiAgentObservation",
    "observation_config": {
        "type": "Kinematics",  # ❌ Hardcoded to only Kinematics
        "features": ["presence", "x", "y", "vx", "vy", "cos_h", "sin_h"],
        "absolute": True
    }
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Tasks Documentation
- Added task 4.1: "Implement multi-modal data collection for ambulance scenarios"
- Updated design document to clarify multi-modal support requirements

### 2. Fixed Ambulance Scenarios Configuration
- **Removed hardcoded observation configurations** from ambulance scenarios
- **Enabled dynamic observation type selection** like the main highway system
- **Added support for all 3 observation types**:
  - **Kinematics**: Vehicle state data (position, velocity, heading)
  - **OccupancyGrid**: Spatial grid representation 
  - **GrayscaleObservation**: Visual/image observations

```python
# AFTER (dynamic - supports all 3 types)
# Note: observation and action configs are set dynamically by MultiAgentEnvFactory
# to support all 3 observation types (Kinematics, OccupancyGrid, GrayscaleObservation)
base_config = {
    "lanes_count": 4,
    "controlled_vehicles": 4,
    # ... other config parameters
    # ✅ No hardcoded observation config - enables multi-modal collection
}
```

### 3. Updated ScenarioRegistry
- Removed observation/action validation constraints (now handled dynamically)
- Added method to get supported observation types for ambulance scenarios
- Updated validation to work with dynamic observation configuration

### 4. Enhanced Documentation
- Updated design document with multi-modal data collection section
- Enhanced README with detailed observation type information
- Added examples showing all 3 data types and their characteristics

## Results Achieved

### ✅ Multi-Modal Data Collection Now Supported
The ambulance scenarios now support all 3 observation types:

1. **Kinematics Observations**
   - Shape: (15, 7) 
   - Features: presence, x, y, vx, vy, cos_h, sin_h
   - Use case: Vehicle dynamics analysis, trajectory planning

2. **OccupancyGrid Observations**
   - Shape: (2, 11, 11)
   - Features: Binary occupancy in spatial grid
   - Use case: Spatial reasoning, obstacle detection

3. **GrayscaleObservation**
   - Shape: (4, 128, 64)
   - Features: Grayscale images with stack size 4
   - Use case: Computer vision, visual perception

### ✅ Dynamic Environment Creation
The system can now create environments with any observation type:

```python
# Create ambulance environment with Kinematics
env_kin = factory.create_ambulance_env("highway_emergency_light", "Kinematics", 4)

# Create ambulance environment with OccupancyGrid  
env_grid = factory.create_ambulance_env("highway_emergency_light", "OccupancyGrid", 4)

# Create ambulance environment with GrayscaleObservation
env_visual = factory.create_ambulance_env("highway_emergency_light", "GrayscaleObservation", 4)

# Create parallel environments for all 3 types simultaneously
parallel_envs = factory.create_parallel_ambulance_envs("highway_emergency_light", 4)
```

### ✅ Validation and Testing
- All existing tests pass
- Created comprehensive demonstration script showing multi-modal capabilities
- Verified environment creation works for all 3 observation types
- Confirmed parallel environment creation for simultaneous multi-modal collection

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `collecting_ambulance_data/scenarios/ambulance_scenarios.py` - Removed hardcoded observation configs
- `highway_datacollection/scenarios/registry.py` - Updated validation for dynamic configs

### Documentation
- `.kiro/specs/ambulance-data-collection/tasks.md` - Added multi-modal task
- `.kiro/specs/ambulance-data-collection/design.md` - Added multi-modal section
- `collecting_ambulance_data/README.md` - Enhanced with observation type details

### Testing and Examples
- `tests/test_ambulance_scenario_registry.py` - Updated tests for dynamic configs
- `examples/ambulance_multimodal_demo.py` - New demonstration script

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 1.2**: "WHEN the ambulance ego vehicle is active THEN it SHALL maintain all existing observation modalities (Kinematics, OccupancyGrid, GrayscaleObservation)"

✅ **Requirement 1.4**: "WHEN data collection runs THEN all existing data collection features SHALL remain functional"

## Impact

### Before
- ❌ Only 1 data type collected (Kinematics)
- ❌ Hardcoded observation configuration
- ❌ Limited research capabilities

### After  
- ✅ All 3 data types supported (Kinematics, OccupancyGrid, GrayscaleObservation)
- ✅ Dynamic observation type selection
- ✅ Full multi-modal research capabilities
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing tools
- ✅ Parallel environment creation for simultaneous collection

The ambulance data collection system now provides comprehensive multi-modal data collection capabilities, enabling researchers to collect visual, spatial, and kinematic data simultaneously for emergency vehicle scenarios.
