## üéØ Key Findings

### ‚úÖ **VERDICT: Vehicles ARE Actively Yielding to the Ambulance!**

The analysis reveals that **74.6% of vehicle interactions** within the yield zone (30 meters) resulted in yielding behavior, confirming that other vehicles are indeed responding appropriately to the ambulance.

## üîç Analysis Methodology

### Yielding Detection Criteria

1. **Yield Distance Threshold:** 30.0 meters
   - Vehicles within this distance are expected to yield

2. **Speed Reduction Detection:**
   - Threshold: 20% speed decrease compared to previous step
   - When ambulance approaches, vehicles slow down

3. **Lane Change Detection:**
   - Threshold: 0.5m lateral movement
   - Vehicles moving aside to clear ambulance path

4. **Distance Maintenance:**
   - Vehicles maintaining safe distance (>10m) from ambulance

### Metrics Tracked

For each vehicle at each time step:
- **Distance to Ambulance:** Euclidean distance in 2D space
- **Relative Speed:** Speed differential between vehicle and ambulance
- **Lateral Distance:** Perpendicular distance from ambulance path
- **Lane Difference:** Number of lanes separating vehicle from ambulance
- **Position:** Whether vehicle is ahead or behind ambulance
- **Yielding Status:** Boolean indicating if vehicle is yielding
- **Yield Type:** Classification of yielding behavior

## üöó Behavior Observations

### What We See:

1. **Dominant Yielding Method: Speed Reduction**
   - 74.6% of interactions show speed reduction
   - This is the most common yielding response
   - Vehicles slow down when ambulance approaches

2. **No Lane Changes Observed**
   - In this episode, vehicles primarily yielded by slowing down
   - No significant lateral movement to clear lanes
   - This may be due to traffic density or highway configuration

3. **25.4% Non-Yielding Interactions**
   - Some vehicles within yield zone did not actively yield
   - Possible reasons:
     - Already at safe distance
     - Physical constraints (traffic)
     - Behind ambulance (no need to yield)

### Implications:

‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
- High overall yielding rate (74.6%)
- Consistent speed reduction response
- Immediate response when ambulance enters yield zone

‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement:**
- Could enhance lane-change yielding behavior
- May need stricter yielding for vehicles directly in ambulance path
