### 12.4 Practical Data Usage Examples

#### 12.4.1 Loading and Analyzing Parquet Data

**Basic Data Loading:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path

# Load a single scenario's data
scenario_path = Path("data/highway_multimodal_dataset/free_flow")
parquet_files = list(scenario_path.glob("*_transitions.parquet"))

# Combine multiple episode files
dfs = []
for file in parquet_files:
    df = pd.read_parquet(file)
    dfs.append(df)

combined_df = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)
print(f"Loaded {len(combined_df)} transitions from {len(parquet_files)} episodes")
```

**Efficient Column Selection:**
```python
# Load only required columns for faster processing
feature_columns = ['episode_id', 'step', 'agent_id', 'action', 'reward', 
                  'ttc', 'speed', 'lane_position', 'summary_text']
df = pd.read_parquet('transitions.parquet', columns=feature_columns)
```

**Binary Data Reconstruction:**
```python
def reconstruct_occupancy_grid(row):
    """Reconstruct occupancy grid from Parquet binary data."""
    if pd.isna(row['occ_blob']):
        return None
    
    # Extract binary data and metadata
    blob_data = row['occ_blob']
    shape = eval(row['occ_shape']) if isinstance(row['occ_shape'], str) else row['occ_shape']
    dtype = row['occ_dtype']
    
    # Reconstruct numpy array
    return np.frombuffer(blob_data, dtype=dtype).reshape(shape)

# Usage example
sample_row = df.iloc[0]
occupancy_grid = reconstruct_occupancy_grid(sample_row)
print(f"Reconstructed occupancy grid: {occupancy_grid.shape}")
```

#### 12.4.2 Advanced Analytics with Parquet

**Time Series Analysis:**
```python
# Efficient time-based filtering
episode_data = df[df['episode_id'] == 'ep_20250921_001']
time_series = episode_data.sort_values('step')

# Analyze reward progression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(time_series['step'], time_series['reward'])
plt.title('Reward Progression Over Episode')
plt.xlabel('Step')
plt.ylabel('Reward')
```

**Safety Analysis:**
```python
# Analyze dangerous situations (low TTC)
dangerous_situations = df[
    (df['ttc'] < 2.0) & 
    (df['ttc'] != np.inf) & 
    (df['speed'] > 15.0)
]

print(f"Found {len(dangerous_situations)} dangerous situations")
print(f"Average TTC in dangerous situations: {dangerous_situations['ttc'].mean():.2f}s")
```

**Multi-Agent Behavior Analysis:**
```python
# Compare agent behaviors
agent_stats = df.groupby('agent_id').agg({
    'reward': ['mean', 'std'],
    'action': lambda x: x.value_counts().to_dict(),
    'ttc': lambda x: (x[x != np.inf]).mean(),
    'speed': 'mean'
})

print("Agent Performance Comparison:")
print(agent_stats)
```
